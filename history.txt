- Standardized all backend task responses to use _id instead of id, ensuring consistent task identification for the frontend.
- Normalized all tasks in the frontend after fetching, so every task object always has an _id property (using id as fallback if present).
- Fixed the bug where handleDeleteTask was called with undefined due to some tasks having id instead of _id.
- Added debug logging to TaskRow to trace task object structure and identify the root cause of the delete bug.
- Ensured all delete handlers and props across components expect and use a string _id, not a Task object or undefined.
- Confirmed the delete flow is now robust and error-free for both mock DB and real backend.
- Prepared the codebase for further UI/UX improvements, such as fixing the Edit Task popup.
