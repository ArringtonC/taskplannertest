- **Always Reference tasks.md:**
  - All task-related documentation, updates, and references should point to [tasks.md](mdc:tasks.md)
  - Ensure any new or updated tasks are reflected in this file
  - Use this file as the single source of truth for task management

- **Examples:**
  - When documenting a new task, add it to [tasks.md](mdc:tasks.md)
  - When referencing a task in other documentation, link to [tasks.md](mdc:tasks.md)
